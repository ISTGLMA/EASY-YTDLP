# What is EASY-YTDLP?
**EASY-YTDLP** is a visual interfaced terminal that allows you to use **YT-DLP** with ease. This is for those who don't really like using the terminal and typing in commands, this fixes that and makes it very simple and easy.

It is currently in **ALPHA** so it offers **3** essential features: 
+ **Download Single Videos**
+ **Download Audio** 
+ **Download Playlist** 

I'll likely update this in the future adding more options.

**YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE THIS TOOL, IT'S JUST FOR THOSE WHO PREFER EASE OF USE.**
